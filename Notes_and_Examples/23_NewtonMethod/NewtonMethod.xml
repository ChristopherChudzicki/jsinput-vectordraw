<p>Below is a graph of the function \(y(x) =\sin(x)\). Your goal is to find the first positive zero of this function using Newton's method. Recall that Newton's method is an iterative approach to finding the zeros of a function using tangent line approximations.</p>

<p>Starting from an initial guess \(x_0=0.5\), draw the first two tangent lines used in Newton's method and determine the next two approximations for the root.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The grader will always mark you as correct.</li>
    <li>Grading this problem is currently infeasible, I thinkâ€”too large a range of acceptable slopes. If the background image were a JSXGraph board, I could check the student's answer is self-consistent.</li>
    <li>Would be great to add points at \(x_1\) and \(x_2\).</li>
</ul>
